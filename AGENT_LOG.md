### 2026-07-03 16:48 MSK — Audit of screenshot-driven Windows agent
- **Did:** Mapped Windows agent architecture end-to-end (adapter-windows RPA layer, runtime capture,
  orchestrator autonomous loop, recovery). Ran baseline `start-orchestrator-session-windows.py --tick`.
- **Files read:** `adapter-windows/.../rpa/{executor/visual_executor,perception/target_locator,verification/ui_verifier,driver/input_driver,session_state}.py`,
  `runtime.py`, `orchestrator.py` (`_run_loop` L798-831), `recovery.py`, `in_process_clients.py`, `test_windows_session_tick.py`.
- **Verified:** Baseline single-tick script fails standalone — default `SessionOrchestrator()` uses HTTP
  adapter clients (ports 8100+) which aren't running → `httpx.ConnectError`. In-process path
  (`SessionOrchestrator(clients=InProcessClients())` + registered adapter) is the way to run mock cross-platform.
- **Result:** Architecture is mature; the gap for the stated goal is the **autonomous long-run harness**
  (continuous loop entrypoint, checkpoint/resume, watchdog), not the perception/decision core.
- **Files changed:** created AGENT_STATUS/TODO/LOG/DECISIONS/BLOCKERS.md.
- **Next:** [#1] in-process windows adapter registry helper, then [#2] autonomous runner.

### 2026-07-03 16:55 MSK — Autonomous runner + checkpoint/resume (tasks #1,#2,#3)
- **Did:** Built the autonomous long-run harness and the in-process wiring it needs.
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/shared-utils/src/uno_shared/adapter_registry.py` — `GenericAdapterClient` gains
    optional `transport=` (ASGI) via new `_client()` helper; all 6 HTTP calls routed through it.
    Backward compatible (default None = real network).
  - `services/session-orchestrator/src/uno_orchestrator/in_process_clients.py` — new
    `setup_in_process_windows_registry()` registers adapter-windows over ASGI transport.
  - `scripts/run-windows-agent.py` — NEW. Continuous tick loop; `--max-ticks`/`--max-duration`/
    `--tick-interval`; atomic JSON checkpoint per tick; `--resume`; JSONL run log; SIGINT/SIGTERM
    graceful stop; `--in-process` (default) / `--http`.
- **How verified:**
  - `run-windows-agent --run-id smoke --max-ticks 5` → attach OK, 5/5 ticks ok (perceive→decide
    (mock model)→execute→record). Artifacts in `artifacts/agent-runs/smoke/`.
  - `--resume --max-ticks 3` → tick_count continued 6→8, restarts=1, atomic checkpoint intact.
  - `ruff check` clean; `pytest test_windows_session_tick + test_orchestrator_windows_attach` → 8 passed.
- **Result:** Autonomous loop + cross-session resume works end-to-end on the cross-platform mock path.
- **Next:** [#4] process-level watchdog/auto-restart, then [#5] long-run mock validation + fault injection.

### 2026-07-03 17:05 MSK — Watchdog + adaptive backoff + long-run/fault validation (#4,#5)
- **Did:** Added process supervisor, self-healing backoff, and validated long unattended runs.
- **Files changed:**
  - `scripts/watchdog-windows-agent.py` — NEW. Supervises the runner; restarts on crash with
    exponential backoff (`--backoff`/`--backoff-max`), `--max-restarts`, always `--resume`;
    forwards SIGINT/SIGTERM; stops on clean child exit (rc=0). Passthrough args → runner.
  - `scripts/run-windows-agent.py` — adaptive backoff: after N consecutive tick errors, wait
    `min(interval*2^N, --error-backoff-max)` before next tick; a success resets cadence.
- **How verified (all on local-mock-uno, in-process):**
  - Watchdog clean-exit: rc=0 → no restart. Crash path: forced non-zero → 2 restarts w/ backoff → giveup.
  - 100-tick continuous run: **0 process crashes**, clean exit. (60 "errors" were adapter 429
    rate-limits from a deliberately aggressive 0.02s interval — an adapter guard, not an agent bug.)
  - 40 ticks @ 0.15s (under rate limit): **40/40 ok**.
  - Adaptive backoff @ 0.02s: self-heals — 22/30 ok with 8 backoff→recover cycles (was ~40% without).
  - **Fault injection:** `kill -9` at tick 5 → checkpoint durable → `--resume` continued 6→9, restarts=1.
- **Result:** Autonomous + recoverable + resumable + long-run + fault-tolerant — all confirmed on mock.
  DoD met except the real-Windows/pywinauto run (#B1, needs a Windows host).
- **Next:** [#8] docs (runbook + resume), then [#6] verification hardening (backlog).
